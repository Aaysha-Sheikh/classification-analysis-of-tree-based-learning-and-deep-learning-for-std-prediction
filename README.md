# Comparative Analysis of Tree-Based vs Deep Learning Algorithms for STD Prediction

This project presents a comparative study between **tree-based machine learning algorithms** and **deep learning models** for predicting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The work was carried out in two phases:  
- Phase I: Random Forest on the original dataset (baseline).  
- Phase II: SMOTE balancing and additional models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP, and 1D-CNN).

## ðŸ§ª Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoded categorical variables  
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler`  

2. **Data Balancing**  
   - Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**  
   - Ensured balanced distribution of STD-positive and STD-negative cases  

3. **Models Implemented**  
   - ðŸŒ² Random Forest (baseline & resampled)  
   - ðŸŒ³ Gradient Boosting  
   - ðŸ¤– Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)  
   - ðŸ“Š 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC-AUC  
   - 5-Fold Cross Validation

## ðŸ“ˆ Results Summary

| Model                    | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest (Imbalanced)| 96%      | 0.94      | 0.94   | 0.94     |
| Random Forest (SMOTE)     | 93%      | 0.93      | 0.93   | 0.93     |
| Gradient Boosting         | 84%      | 0.85      | 0.85   | 0.84     |
| MLP                       | 72%      | 0.72      | 0.72   | 0.72     |
| 1D-CNN                    | 76%      | 0.76      | 0.76   | 0.76     |

âœ… **Random Forest** (after SMOTE) consistently delivered the best results, while deep learning models showed potential but were limited by dataset size.
